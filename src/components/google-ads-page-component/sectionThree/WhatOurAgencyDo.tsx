                            Many Google Ads agencies operate on a "set it and forget it" model. Weâ€™re quite the opposite. We monitor your accounts daily, are in touch with you weekly, and are consistently pushing your ROI forward. We aim to provide a best-in-class service and operate as an extension of your marketing team.

                            After the initial campaign has been run, you will receive weekly reports. This will allow you to see results in real-time and can give you a competitive edge. These reports will measure the return on investment (ROI), and we will go through these with you to help you understand the results.
                            </p>

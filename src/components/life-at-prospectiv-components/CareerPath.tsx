                    We have a clear pathway and proven track record of enabling our people to achieve their potential â€“ be that within Customer Success or other areas of our business.

                    Within Customer Success, we recognise that people management is not for everyone, and have two clear, separate paths for the respective skill-sets needed to bring success.</p>
